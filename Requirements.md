### This project will fulfill two user stories:  
- As a blog visitor,
I want to subscribe to the newsletter,
So that I can receive email updates when new content is published on the blog;

- As the blog author,
I want to send an email to all my subscribers,
So that I can notify them when new content is published. 

### The iterative work involved: 
Each iteration takes a fixed amount of time and gives us a slightly better
version of the product, improving the experience of our users. 
We are iterating on product features, not engineering quality: the code produced in each iteration will be tested and properly documented even if 
it only delivers a tiny, fully functional feature.  

### Subscription functionality: 
Getting off the ground will require some initial heavy-lifting: 
- choosing a web framework
- setting up the infrastructure for managing database migrations
- putting together our application scaffolding
- setup for integration testing.
